frontend-nanodegree-feedreader
=============================

This is my version of a JavaScript feedreader app tested using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for Project 6 of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree] (https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001).

This project provided experience with writing a number of tests against a pre-existing JavaScript application using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

**Associated Udacity courses include:**

* [JavaScript Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud549)

**Goal of the Project:**


* To learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These test the underlying business logic of the application as well as event handling and DOM manipulation.
* Create tests that are comprehensive enough to test the app functionality.

**Bonus:**

* Additional tests that test additional features within the application.

###Running the Tests:

To run the tests, clone it from my github account:

```
git clone https://github.com/benplant/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
```

and then open index.html in your browser.

The Jasmine spec results will show at the bottom of the window.

###Results:

* All required tests pass and are comprehensive enough to test the app.
* Bonus tests and functionality added to allow sorting of feeds by clicking on the feed header title.
